~ Factorial Calculator Using Iteration ~

func factorial(n) {
    Let result = 1
    Let counter = 1

    Run while(counter <= n) {
        result = result * counter
        counter = counter + 1

    give result
}

Let number1 = 5
Let result = factorial(number1)

out("Factorial of ")
out(number1)
out(" is ")
out(result)

~ Calculate another ~
Let number = 7
Let answer = factorial(number)

out("Factorial of ")
out(number)
out(" is ")
out(answer)

~ One more example ~
Let value = 10
Let output = factorial(value)

out("Factorial of ")
out(value)
out(" is ")
out(output)
